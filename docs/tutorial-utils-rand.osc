# RANDOM
# ------
# single-value commands (commands with only one value as
# agrument besides the TARGET), can be randomized with
# the '/rand' command, which takes has a somewhat confusing
# syntax, but which is consistent with the actor command syntax:
# /rand /CMD TARGET MIN MAX

# firts let's create something

/free *
/new box box

# to randomize it's size we would use

/rand /scale box 0.1 2

# randomizing rotation would be done with

/rand /rotate box 0 360
