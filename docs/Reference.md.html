                          **Animatron OSC Command Reference**

This document exposes the API available (via OSC commands) through
Animatron.

# OSC Commands

!!! Note
    OSC argument types are specified by a suffix after the name: `s`
    is a **string**, `i` is an **integer**, `f` is a **float**.

!!! Note
    Commands with an optional initial `[anim]` argument will apply to
    the current set of *selected* anims when this argument is skipped.
    If the `[anim]` argument is sent, then it will look for anim
    targets matching that name. Note that `*` (match zero or more
    characters) and `?` (match exactly one character) may be used as
    anim name wildcards.

Address | Args | Description
--------|------|------------
`/create` | `anim:s type:s` | Create a new anim with a given animation type. If the named anim already exists, change its animation type to the one specified. The initial position of a new anim will be random.
`/free` | `[anim:s]` | Delete the anim (remove its instance).
`/list` | | Get list of current anim instances. Returned in the form of a `/list/reply` OSC message.
`/types` | | Get list of available animation types. Returned in the form of a `/types/reply` OSC message.
`/play` | `[anim:s]` | Play the anim from the current frame.
`/stop` | `[anim:s]` | Stop playing the anim.
`/frame` | `[anim:s] frame:i` | Jump to the given frame number (with wrapping).
`/position` | `[anim:s] x:f y:f` | Set the anim to the x,y coordinates (specified as fractions of the viewport from 0-1).
`/speed` | `[anim:s] rate:f` | Set the playback speed (1 is normal speed).
`/fliph` | `[anim:s]` | Flip the anim horizontally.
`/flipv` | `[anim:s]` | Flip the anim vertically.
`/color` | `[anim:s] red:f green:f blue:f` | Add an RGB colour to the anim. Set to black (0,0,0) to restore original colour.
`/say` | `[anim:s] text:s [dur:f]` | Have the anim "say" something via a speech bubble, with an optional duration (defaults to three seconds).
`/group` | `group:s [anim:s]` | Add the anim to a named group. If run without `anim` it will return the list of anims in the group.
`/ungroup` | `group:s anim:s` | Remove the anim from a named group.
`/select` | `[anim:s]` | Add the anim to the seletect set. If run without `anim` it will return the list of selected anims.
`/deselect` | `[anim:s]` | Remove the anim from the selected set. If run without `anim` it will deselect all (equivalent to `/deselect "*"`).
`/selected` | | Get the list of selected anims.

# OSC Replies

These are the OSC messages that can be sent from Animatron to a client
application, such as SuperCollider, which is sending OSC commands.

Address | Args | Description
--------|------|------------
`/error/reply` | `error:s` | Return an error message to the client.
`/status/reply` | `status:s` | Return a status message to the client.
`/list/reply` | `[anim:s] ...` | Return the list of instanced anims to the client (one name per argument).
`/types/reply` | `[type:s] ...` | Return the list of available animation types to the client (one name per argument).
