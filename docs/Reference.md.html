                          **Animatron Reference**

This document exposes the API available (via OSC commands) through
Animatron.

# OSC Commands

!!! Note
    OSC argument types are specified by a suffix after the name: `s`
    is a **string**, `i` is an **integer**, `f` is a **float**.

!!! Note
    Commands with an optional initial `[actor]` argument will apply to
    the current set of *selected* actors when this argument is skipped.
    If the `[actor]` argument is sent, then it will look for actor
    targets matching that name. Note that `*` (match zero or more
    characters) and `?` (match exactly one character) may be used as
    actor name wildcards.

Address | Args | Description
--------|------|------------
`/create` | `actor:s anim:s` | Create a new actor with a given (loaded) animation. If the named actor already exists, change its animation to the one specified. The initial position of a new actor will be random.
`/free` | `[actor:s]` | Delete the actor (remove its instance).
`/list` or `/list/actors` | | Get list of current actor instances. Returned in the form of a `/list/actors/reply` OSC message.
`/list/anims` | | Get list of available (loaded) animations. Returned in the form of a `/list/anims/reply` OSC message.
`/list/assets` | | Get list of available (unloaded) assets on disk. Returned in the form of a `/list/assets/reply` OSC message.
`/play` | `[actor:s]` | Play the actor's animation from the current frame.
`/stop` | `[actor:s]` | Stop playing the actor's animation.
`/frame` | `[actor:s] frame:i` | Jump to the given frame number (with wrapping).
`/position` | `[actor:s] x:f y:f` | Set the actor to the x,y coordinates (specified as fractions of the viewport from 0-1).
`/speed` | `[actor:s] rate:f` | Set the playback speed (1 is normal speed).
`/fliph` | `[actor:s]` | Flip the actor horizontally.
`/flipv` | `[actor:s]` | Flip the actor vertically.
`/color` | `[actor:s] red:f green:f blue:f` | Add an RGB colour to the actor. Set to black (0,0,0) to restore its original colour.
`/say` | `[actor:s] text:s [dur:f]` | Have the actor "say" something via a speech bubble, with an optional duration (defaults to three seconds).
`/group` | `group:s [actor:s]` | Add the actor to a named group. If run without `actor` it will return the list of actors in the group.
`/ungroup` | `group:s actor:s` | Remove the actor from a named group.
`/select` | `[actor:s]` | Add the actor to the selected set. If run without `actor` it will return the list of selected actors.
`/deselect` | `[actor:s]` | Remove the actor from the selected set. If run without `actor` it will deselect all (equivalent to `/deselect "*"`).
`/selected` | | Get the list of selected actors.

# OSC Replies

These are the OSC messages that can be sent from Animatron to a client
application, such as SuperCollider, which is sending OSC commands.

Address | Args | Description
--------|------|------------
`/error/reply` | `error:s` | Return an error message to the client.
`/status/reply` | `status:s` | Return a status message to the client.
`/list/actors/reply` | `[actor:s] ...` | Return the list of instanced actors to the client (one name per argument).
`/list/anims/reply` | `[anim:s] ...` | Return the list of available (loaded) animations to the client (one name per argument).
`/list/assets/reply` | `[asset:s] ...` | Return the list of available (unloaded) assets to the client (one name per argument). Assets must be loaded as anims in order to create actor instances.

# Custom sprite sheets

You must place PNG or JPEG sprite sheet files in the `animations/`
directory under the Animatron folder. These are considered "assets",
and will be loaded as sprite sheets at launch and made available as a
library of animations.  There is a naming convention to specify the
sprite layout and frame rate:

`NAME_COLSxROWS_FPSfps.png`

where:
- *NAME* - is the name of the animation, by which it will be identified in commands.
- *COLS* - number of columns of the spritesheet
- *ROWS* - number of rows of the spritesheet
- *FPS* - animation's framerate

!!! Tip
    The separators between *NAME* and *COLS* and between *ROWS* and *FPS*
    **must be underlines** (`_`), not hyphens (`-`).

Here is an example:

`my-animation_6x4_12fps.png` would load as an animation called
`my-animation` using a 6x4 sprite layout, playing at 12 frames per
second.  Then an actor could be created from it using an OSC message
like this:

`/create, "aname", "my-animation"`
             
For files that don't follow this (*name_dims_rate.png*) naming
convention, the entire filename will be used as the animation name in
Animatron, and they will be assumed to contain 4x4 sprites and play at
24 fps.
