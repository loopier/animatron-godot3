# ACTORS
# ------
# An ACTOR plays an image sequence (ANIM).

# First we nead to load the ANIM into memory with the '/load' command.
# The argument is the ASSET (file) name.

/load box-spitneat

# to see a list of all the assets use

/list/assets

# now we can create an actor that plays the animation we just loaded.
# 'box' is the actor NAME, and 'box-spitneat' the name of the ASSET that
# we want it to play

/create box box-spitneat

# we can do both steps (load an create) at once with

/new box box-spitneat

# or by evaluating a block

/load box-spitneat
/create box box-spitneat

# WARINING: long image sequences take a while to load, and the application
# will freeze while loading, so it's better to pre-load the assets first, then
# they'll be available without having to reload them, even if no actors
# are using them.

# to remove an actor from the stage

/free box

# more than one actor can use the same animation

/create box-1 box-spitneat

/create box-2 box-spitneat

# You probably won't see it very well because they are one on top of the other.
# We would need to move the one on top to see both of them.
# In the next section we cover how to do this -- and other things.

# but first, let's clear the stage using a wildcard '*', which is a way to
# quickly access all actors on stage
